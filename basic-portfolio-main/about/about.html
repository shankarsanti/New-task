                    <p>I'm a software engineer from Karnataka, India. I love coding and creating websites that solve real problems. I come from a humble background, but I've always enjoyed my life and made the most of every opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, I love traveling and photography. Exploring new places and capturing beautiful moments brings me joy. In my free time, I also enjoy reading books, which helps me learn new things and think differently.</p>
                    <p>I believe in helping others, especially those who need support. I also love sharing my coding skills and knowledge with my friends. Learning and teaching go hand in hand for me—when I help others learn, I grow too.</p>
